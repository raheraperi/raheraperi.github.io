                    <h3>"You're not in consumer mode, you're in creator mode"</h3>
                <h2><em>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</em></h2>
                    <p>It's a transformative experience where you take control of your education, build life-long relationships with your cohort and teachers while working the hardest you've ever worked in your life. </p>
                <h2><em>What are your impressions?</em> </h2>
                    <p> It makes my heart sing to see that human skills / "engineering empathy" is taken as seriously as the technical work. 
                        I'm extremely excited to embark on this life-changing journey to become the creator of my own destiny. </p>
                <h2><em>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</em></h2>
                    <p> There's a Maori proverb that encapsulates my feelings very well: <br>
                        He aha te mea nui o te ao? He t훮ngata, he t훮ngata, he t훮ngata! What is the most important thing in the world? It is people, it is people, it is people!<br>
                        There's definitely a sense of people/creators/customers being the core consideration of EDA. Collaboration, pairing and co-creation help us thrive and achieve more than we ever thought possible. As Karim says "if you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together". <br> </p>    
                <h2><em>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</em></h2>
                    <p> In the lead up to Phase 0 I had a lot of korero with alumni, EDA teachers and friends about my pivot into the world of coding. I'm a bit of a research nerd admittedly, so I felt reasonably clued up on what to expect. </p>
                <h2><em>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</em></h2>
                    <p> I'm super excited with a side of imposter syndrome. It's refreshing to see something different to the stuffy, old-school education system that I've experienced. <br>
                        I'm trying to retrain that voice that tells me I'm not good enough to tell me I'm awesome!
                    </p>
