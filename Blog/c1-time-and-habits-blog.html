                        <h2><em>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</em></h2>
                            
                            <p> I found the Pomodoro technique simple and straightforward to maintain focus on the task at hand.<br>
                                Mindfulness, meditation and yoga have been a huge part of my life for eight years.
                                I find that my optimal flow comes when I have a regular yoga and meditation practice. 
                                You're less caught up in the stories the mind tells us, particularly those that try and tell us we're not good enough or worthy.
                            </p>

                        <h2><em>What did you find interesting?</em></h2>
                
                            <p> I found Carol Dweck's concepts of the fixed vs. growth mindsets to be very insightful. <br>
                                A fixed mindset is a bi-product of the conventional, old school pedagogy of our current education system. 
                                Understanding that our talents and abilities can develop through effort rather than being inate/fixed is vital. 
                                If you believe you can improve and put in the effort, then you will see results!
                            </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h2><em>What worked for you?</em></h2>

                            <p> It probably sounds cheesy, but I tried out some new positivity mantras to counteract any negative thoughts. 
                                I found these to be super effective when I caught my imposter syndrome symptoms creeping up. <br>
                            </p>   
                        <h2><em>Which will you experiment further with? </em></h2>
                
                            <p> I will be experimenting more with tiny habits. I used to be a terrible procrastinator, and although this has somewhat improved I think there are lots of efficiencies to be discovered in my work/study life through creating tiny habits. <br>
                                Changing behaviour is no small feat, but the Fogg method is all about simplicity!
