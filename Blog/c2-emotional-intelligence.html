                    <h2><em>Emotional Intelligence - Engineering Empathy</em></h2>
                        <p>
                        When I started learning about EDA, the Human Skills component of the course really struck me. 
                    A school that teaches people to be awesome programmers that also values empathy, compassion and kindness?! 
                        I was immediately sold. 
                        </p>
            
                        <p>  
                        Emotional intelligence enables three important skill sets: optimal work performance, leadership skills, 
                    and the ability to create an environment where happiness thrives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Emotional intelligence (EQ) is equally, if not more important than more ‘technical’ intelligence such as logical-mathematical. 
                    We are recognising this shift in different studies which has seen that those who are strong in both emotional and ‘rational’ intelligence 
                        outperform their peers who lack EQ but are strong in technical intelligence. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        When we are attuned to our intuition and developing our emotional intelligence, we are able to leverage this to perform at a higher 
                    level than we ever knew we were capable of. We do this through improving our self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship 
                        management. 
                        </p>

                <div class="column">
                        <p> I started my own spiritual journey a number of years ago, and with the surge in corporate companies understanding the value that 
                        mindfulness has for the health and wellbeing of employees, mindfulness has gone from solely being a part of my personal life to 
                            encompassing my whole life. 
                        </p>   
                        <p> 
                        Learning about the science of mindfulness in this chapter was very interesting. One study gave an overview of how meditation impacts brain.
                    “The neural process works even better and an additional part of the brain called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex gets recruited as well. 
                        It suggests that mindfulness can help your brain utilize more of its circuitry, thereby making it more effective at managing emotions.”

                    <h2><em>Mindulfness Learnings</em></h2>
                        <p>
                        I’m not a stranger to mindfulness - I practice meditation and yoga about 3-4 times a week. I started my journey about eight years ago 
                    when I was a highly strung, angsty teen starting uni. It really has changed my life and helped me become the calm, resilient and happy 
                        person I am today. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I really liked how the chapter broke down mindfulness really simply into the ‘Easy’ and ‘Easier’ way. In the Easy Way we bring gentle 
                    and consistent attention to your breath for two minutes. In the Easier Way we simply sit without an agenda for two minutes. Surely we 
                        all have two minutes of our day to spare to sit in stillness!
