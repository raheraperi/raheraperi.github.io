                            <p class="text-justify">
                                I had a conversation with a friend who recently met an amazing guy. 
                            He was here on holiday and has now gone back to Australia and she was going through 
                                a rollercoaster of emotions. I as able to listen, and connect with her emotions 
                            enabling her to voice how she was feeling without judgement. 
                            </p>

                        <h3> How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">
                                It was beautiful! It's easy to be overly harsh and critical of the self and loved ones.
                            We hold the ones we love to high account - the loving kindness meditation helped me reflect on
                                my sister and the difficult times she's been through recently but also made me super grateful
                            to have such a loving, kind, brave person in my life.
                            </p>
                        <h3> Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            A difficult situation from my past was a fairly high-profile project that I was involved in which impacted 
                                Auckland's communities. There was a large social media group against the decisions made by the organisation 
                            and the social media backlash was very strong. There were a few commentators making personal attacks on employees. 
                                One comment in particular I really took issue with and decided to respond in defence of the person in question. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            From the social media keyboard warrior's point of view, I understand that they may feel strongly against this project
                                because they've lived in this community for years. Change is not always easy for people who have been doing things the same 
                            way for many years - even decades. They spoke up on social media because perhaps they felt that their views were not
                                being heard in any other environment. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Empathy was critical for me to understand why this person was acting in such a childish and mean-spirited manner. 
                        </p>
                        <h3> Any other musings</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                       Kindness and empathy are very important - but it's alaso important to have boundaries and not take on everyone's baggage.
