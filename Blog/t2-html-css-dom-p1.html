                    <h2><em> Our New Planet - Reimagining HTML, CSS and the DOM</em></h2>
                        
                        <p> It’s the year 3000 and we have now evolved into super-intelligent beings who have the power to create new planets. 
                            Due to our negligence and laziness we have degraded planet Earth’s environment beyond return, and we must create a new planet for intergalactic colonisation. 
                            Because we’re not very creative, we decide to base our design on an Earth replica. 
                        </p>

                        <p>  
                                3D printing has become highly advanced and we can now create all the large-scale objects - from animals, rivers through to stars that composed planet Earth, from the comfort of our spaceship. 
                                All of these earthly elements can be thought of as HTML objects. 
                        </p>

                        <p> Of course, we can’t just leave these floating around nonsensically, we have forests floating as if they were clouds! 
                            Our intergalactic architect needs to assemble our planet in a way that is functional for us humans, while also being visually appealing. 
                            The design of the earthly elements on our new planet can be thought of as CSS.

                        <p> We’ve also invented a planetary remote control hub as an interface to monitor our new planet and make any requisite changes as voted for by our people. Our planetary remote control hub can be thought of as the DOM.

                        <p> 
                        Boxifying is a concept that helps us understand the grid-like layout of all webpages. <br>
                        Almost like a box inception, when we're viewing a webpage in our browser, we can see the page as a box and within that smaller boxes that house our objects. <br>
                        To boxify means to conceptualise all of the boxes within the spec design so that we can start to understand how to structure our webpage. 
                        </p>

                        <p>  With the importance of boxes in mind when designing our web page, we can visualise all of the elements on our web page living inside a boxes that help us lay out our elements in a coherent manner. <br>
