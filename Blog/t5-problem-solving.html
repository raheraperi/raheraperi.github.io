                        <h3> Scenario I: Branching on Github</h3>
                            <h4>The Problem</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                I was working on the Zen Garden sprint and realised that I had forked my repo incorrectly.
                                </p>
                            <h4>Problem Solving Techniques</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    I spent a good few hours trying to figure out where I had gone wrong. It seemed like a very minor 
                                thing so I thought that it would be best that I try and troubleshoot the issue myself. A few hours later
                                    I realised that I was going to have to admit defeat and seek assistance.
                                </p>
                            <h4>My Response</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    I felt really frustrated and dumb. I questioned myself and whether I was good enough for EDA. Very dramatic, I know. 
                                </p>
                            <h4>Learnings</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    Fortunately I was at EDA when this issue occurred. Don was able to walk me through where I had gone wrong 
                                I learned that I needed to switch branches on Command Line in order to work on different versions of my repo. 
                                    He also taught me a lot of basic but handy tips for using Command Line. 
                                </p>
                        <h3> Scenario II: Elegant Problem Solving </h3>
                            <h4>The Problem</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    Working through all the Sprint 5 Javascript exercises, especially towards the end, I found myself feeling
                                very challenged. 
                                </p>
                            <h4>Problem Solving Techniques</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    I'm not sure if this is an 'elegant technique', but I find it really helpful to solve a lot of JS 
                                by writing all the components of a question down i.e. what are my functions, variables, do I need to use a loop, etc. 
                                    When you have all the information written down in simple terms, or drawn in a diagram if you're a visual learner
                                you can much more easily see exactly what a problem is asking you to solve. 
                                </p>
                            <h4>My Response</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    I used this method to solve a few problems and felt like a champ. I have to admit, there were also a fair 
                                few I had to go googling or ask for a hint from Free Code Camp. 
                                </p>
                            <h4>Learnings</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    I learned that I needed to be patient with myself, and to not let my frustration get the best of me. I also 
                                learned that I need to find ways of learning that help me as a visual learner. Especially when learning JavaScript which
                                    can seem very abstract whereas HTML and CSS are very tangible.
